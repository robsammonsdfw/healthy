<p>
Privacy Statement<br>
This Privacy Statement informs users of the #APPNAME# Web website and the #APPNAME# iPhone application about how ("#APPNAME#" or "we") gathers and uses personal information submitted to #APPNAME# Web and aggregated information collected from the #APPNAME# Web website or via the #APPNAME# iPhone application.<br><br>
Collection of personal information
If you use the #APPNAME# iPhone application, you may enter data into the application running locally on your iPhone, in order to set, track and manage your diet and exercise goals. This data may include your birth date, your height and weight, your gender, and specific details of the foods and drinks that you consume and the exercise you do. If you do not subscribe to #APPNAME# Web or create an account at the #APPNAME# Web website, your Personal data will remain on your iPhone and we will have no access to it.<br><br>
If you subscribe to #APPNAME# Web , you will be asked to provide your email address and to select a password. Subscribing to #APPNAME# Web  will automatically create an account at the #APPNAME# Web website under your email address and password, and your Personal datawill automatically be synched to your website account. If you create an account at the #APPNAME# Web website, you will be asked to provide an email address and password, and you may enter Personal data into the website.<br><br>
In addition to the above personal information, we collect standard information about #APPNAME# Web users such as IP addresses, browser type, operating system, pages visited on our site, referring and exit pages, and the dates and times of the visits. This site visitation data is used to administer the site and provide general statistics regarding the use of loseit.com. Site visitation data is never linked to your personal information, and we do not use it to identify you individually.<br><br>
Use of personal information
We will treat your Personal data as confidential, and we will not share your personal information or Personal data with third parties without your permission, except in the limited circumstances described below.<br><br>
We will use the personal information you give us to fulfill the services and products you request from us. This may include billing and shipping of products that you order, sending information that you have requested, or contacting you about products and services that you have purchased. In some circumstances we may use third party contractors to perform these services on our behalf. In such circumstances, we will only provide the contractor with the information needed to perform the services (for example, name and address if a contractor is delivering a product to you), and all contractors will be required to agree to confidentiality obligations with respect to your personal, non-public information.<br><br>
If you do not opt-out of communications from #APPNAME# Web, we may send you marketing notices including promotions of our products and services. You can opt-out of communications from #APPNAME# Web at any time (see control of personal information below).<br><br>
We may disclose your personal information when we reasonably believe that it is required by a law or legal process and to protect and defend the rights and interests of #APPNAME# Web, its affiliates, suppliers, or users. In the event #APPNAME# Web goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information and Personal data will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
We may use and disclose personal data, in a form that does not identify any individual, to allow #APPNAME# Web and our advertisers to present targeted advertising to you. We may disclose to third parties, including advertisers and potential business partners, aggregated statistics that we develop from Personal data. For example, we may disclose the total number of pounds lost by all #APPNAME# Web users, the average weight loss of #APPNAME# Web users, or generalized information about diet and exercise habits based on aggregated statistics developed from Personal data. This statistical information will not identify any individual.
